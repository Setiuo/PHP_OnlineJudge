There will be no regret and sorrow if you fight with all your strength. Today, give a stranger one of your smiles. It might be the only sunshine he sees all day. Victory belongs to the most persevering. The world is his who enjoys it. "Never give up on something you really want. It's difficult to wait, but worse to regret. Dare and the world always yields. If it beats you sometimes, dare it again and again and it will succumb. Cease to struggle and you cease to live. "Everyone has a sad, want to hide but he who denies all confesses all. A man is not old as long as he is seeking something. A man is not old until regrets take the place of dreams. (J. Barrymore) Disappear a memory. And leaving is unforgettable memories. You have to believe in yourself. Thatâ€˜s the secret of success. -- Charles Chaplin
