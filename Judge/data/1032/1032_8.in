There will be no regret and sorrow if you fight with all your strength. Today, give a stranger one of your smiles. It might be the only sunshine he sees all day. Victory belongs to the most persevering. The world is his who enjoys it. "Never give up on something you really want. It's difficult to wait, but worse to regret. Dare and the world always yields. If it beats you sometimes, dare it again and again and it will succumb. Cease to struggle and you cease to live.
